Down by the salley gardens
My love and I did meet
She passed the salley gardens
With little snow-white feet
She bid me take love easy
As the leaves grow on the tree
But I being young and foolish
With her would not agree
In a field by the river
My love and I did stand
And on my leaning shoulder
She laid her snow-white hand
She bid me take life easy
As the grass grows on the weirs
But I was young and foolish
And now I'm full of tears
